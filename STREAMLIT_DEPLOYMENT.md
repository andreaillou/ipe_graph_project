# Streamlit Deployment Guide

## Your Streamlit app is ready! (`app.py`)

The app has been created but Streamlit requires additional dependencies that need to be installed in your environment.

## To deploy and run your Streamlit app:

### Option 1: Run locally (when dependencies are resolved)

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (FREE and recommended!)

1. **Push your project to GitHub**

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Economic indicators dashboard"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)**

3. **Connect your GitHub repository and deploy!**

   - Select your repository
   - Main file path: `app.py`
   - Click "Deploy"

4. **Your app will be live at**: `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`

### Option 3: Install Streamlit properly

If you have `brew` installed:

```bash
brew install cmake
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
```

Or use conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge streamlit
streamlit run app.py
```

## Features of your app:

✅ **Interactive Charts** - GDP per Capita & Inflation Rate visualizations
✅ **Date Range Selector** - Filter data by year range
✅ **Multiple Views** - Combined, separate, and individual metric views
✅ **Event Annotations** - Highlights major economic events
✅ **Key Metrics Dashboard** - Overview of important statistics
✅ **Raw Data Tables** - View the underlying data
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile

## Files created:

- `app.py` - Main Streamlit application
- `interactive_graph.py` - Standalone Plotly visualization (works now!)
- `combined_graph.py` - Alternative visualization format
- `requirements.txt` - List of required packages

The standalone Plotly files (`interactive_graph.py` and `combined_graph.py`) work perfectly right now with your current environment!
